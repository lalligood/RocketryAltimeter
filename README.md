## Overview ##
High power rocketry (HPR) has few commercial electronic altimeters to choose from and to the best of my knowledge, none of them are released with any software for Linux. So instead of using the Windows-based software that comes with the Perfectflite StratoLogger SL100 (http://www.perfectflite.com/sl100.html), I decided to see if I could take the flight data file from the altimeter & graph the flight data in python.

Unfortunately, I recently lost one of my rockets that had my one & only StratoLogger that I own, so I currently have only one flight's worth of data to test with. And because of losing my altimeter, I have no way of confirming whether or not I can extract the flight data in python. The file I have was captured using the Perfectflite DataCap software for Windows.
